This is my personal website. It's based on Angular 7 and was built using the Angular CLI. It includes lazy loading  and dedicated feature modules for various page types. The CV consists of a static page. I plan to create a separate repo for future blog posts.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
